#+TITLE: My .emacs.d

This is my emacs configuration files.

My setup is split in several modules located in the ~init~
directory. The file ~init.org~ is in charge of loading them.

* Emacs compilation

  Here is a little section on the commands I use to compile Emacs from
  sources, so that I remember which libraries I have to install on my
  system.

  The current apt command is not correct because I already had some
  dependencies installed on my system at the last compilation.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo apt install libxml2-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libfreetype-dev libdbus-dev librsvg2-dev libgtk3-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev texinfo
    ./configure --with-xwidgets --with-modules
    make
    sudo make install
  #+END_SRC
