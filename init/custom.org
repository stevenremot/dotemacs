#+TITLE: Configure custom settings and sources

* Separate custom configuration from init.el

  This is not really handy to have the automatic custom properties set
  in =init.el=. Let's put it in another file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq custom-file (concat my-confdir "custom-configuration.el"))
    (load-file custom-file)
  #+END_SRC

* Add own site-lisp to load path

  I put some code in a separate =site-lisp= dir. Let's add it to the
  load path.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defconst my-site-lisp (concat my-confdir "site-lisp/"))
    (add-to-list 'load-path my-site-lisp)
  #+END_SRC
