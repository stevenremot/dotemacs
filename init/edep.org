#+TITLE: Edep initialization

* Loading

  [[https://github.com/jorissteyn/edep][Edep]] does semantical analysis and tag indexing for PHP project. Some
  of its features collide with My CEDET fork, so I enable only one of
  them at one time. This is why I put it in a separate module.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; EDEP
    (add-to-list 'load-path (concat my-site-lisp "edep"))
    (load (concat my-site-lisp "edep/loaddefs.el"))
  #+END_SRC
